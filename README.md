## Project Overview
This dataset contains 33 columns and 180,519 rows and has undergone a data wrangling process to ensure its usability. It originates from a supply chain or logistics operation, focusing on order management and performance analysis. The dataset includes critical information such as actual and scheduled days for shipping, profit and revenue, and delivery status. It also captures customer details like location, segment, and department, along with order specifics such as product name, price, order status, and shipping mode. This data supports in-depth analysis of delivery performance, customer demographics, and profitability across various regions, products, and delivery methods, offering a comprehensive view of supply chain efficiency and customer service outcomes.

## Tasks
•	Calculate the average actual days for shipping (act_days_for_shipping) and scheduled days for shipping (sch_days_for_shipping) by region. Identify regions where the shipping time consistently exceeds the scheduled time.
•	Analyze the relationship between profit and delivery_status, shipping_mode, and product_status. Identify patterns or correlations and provide recommendations to improve profitability.
•	Segment the data by customer_segment and customer_country to compare profitability, revenue, and order statuses. Identify top-performing segments and those with frequent issues (e.g., late deliveries or cancellations).
•	Analyze product_name and product_status to identify the best-selling products and those frequently associated with issues (e.g., high cancellation rates). Propose strategies for inventory management or promotions based on these findings.
•	Use the latitude_store and longitude_store data to plot the geographical distribution of sales. Identify regions with high sales volumes and those that are underperforming.
•	Examine the order_status and delivery_status across different order_region and order_countrycombinations. Identify bottlenecks in the process and suggest operational improvements.
•	Compare the performance of different shipping_mode options in terms of profit, delivery_status, and order_status. Recommend adjustments to shipping strategies to optimize costs and customer satisfaction.
•	Analyze the relationship between order_item_discount, sales_before_discount, and revenue. Determine whether higher discounts correlate with increased sales volume or revenue. Identify the optimal discount level that maximizes revenue without significantly eroding profit margins.
